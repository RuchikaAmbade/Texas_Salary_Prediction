# Texas Salary Prediction
# Project Overview
This project analyzes salary trends within Texas state government agencies and builds a predictive model to assist in payroll forecasting. It provides insights into salary distributions, wage disparities, and changes in compensation across various roles and departments.

# Problem Statement
The Texas state government aims to better understand employee payroll trends using data analysis and predictive modeling. This project focuses on:

Analyzing salary data from 113 government agencies.

Identifying outliers and wage disparities.

Detecting salary trends and headcount variations over time.

Building a machine learning model to predict salaries.

# Dataset
The dataset contains salary records obtained from the Texas state comptroller under the Texas Public Information Act.

# Attributes
Agency Name, Employee Name, Class Title, Gender, Ethnicity

Employment Status, Hire Date, Hourly Rate, Weekly Hours

Monthly Income, Annual Income, State Number

# Approach & Methodology
1. Data Analysis Report: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) for trends, distributions, and anomalies.

2. Predictive Model Development: Machine learning techniques to forecast salaries based on key features.

3. Outlier Detection: Identifying extreme salary variations.

4. Departmental Analysis: Wage disparities between managers and employees.

5. Trend Evaluation: Changes in salaries across time and departments.

# Model Evaluation
A comparison report assesses multiple machine learning models, with a recommendation for the best-performing model based on metrics such as:

F1-Score

ROC-AUC

Cross-validation performance

# Challenges Faced
Handling missing values and inconsistencies in payroll data.

Feature selection for improving model accuracy.

Managing outliers in salary distributions.
